### Q1: What Happens If I Lose My Bitcoins?

'Losing' here is assumed to mean 'sending bitcoin to a wrong/unintended address'. Unfortunately, since unique private keys are associated with individual Bitcoin addresses,and addresses are anonymous by design, any bitcoin sent to a wrong address cannot be recovered. A possible solution to prevent such a scenario would be to use a multisig mechanism where more than one entity is required to sign a particular transaction before it can be sent to any given address.
